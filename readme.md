# Game Socket

A socket interface game server. Learn from the `example.py`!

# Example:

See [example.py](./example.py)

# Install

Download or clone this repo, put it together with your scripts, then import.

# Describe:

The `server.py` contains a GameServer which is the server. Most time you don't need to rewrite it, just use it.
The `game.py` contains a GameBase which is the game logic. Rewrite the `game_begin` function under you own subclass.
